# object_detection_using_ultrasound

### The project consists of:
* arduino nano (includes atmege 328p),
* two 360-degree MG90s tower pro servos,
* HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
* contact plate
* Male-female and female-female leads
* 2x wheels of the same diameter

The robot simulates the drive with the servos, so it can keep on going forward. Their ability to rotate the wheel lay in one axis,
therefore they must have reverse polarity to drive the vehicle forward. When the robot appears in front of an obstacle of the ultrasonic sensor catches it and the rover turns.
